## Session 1: Document Core vs Cloud Scope Decisions

**Goal:** Codify scope decisions about what belongs in Core OSS vs Cloud SaaS, reflecting recent deletions (telegram-bot, CLI, SDK) and architectural choices (no webhooks, no bots, no scheduled triggers in core).

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Telegram Bot → Cloud only | Core exposes no bot mechanism. Cloud owns TG bot at `cloud/apps/server/api/src/services/telegram-bot/` |
| No webhook triggers in core | Self-hosted core runs on localhost; external services can't reach it without tunnels |
| No cloudUpload node | Cloud outputs go to CDN automatically; no separate upload node needed |
| CLI and SDK removed | Already deleted from core. Docs updated to reflect this |
| Core is UI-triggered only | Workflows triggered exclusively from web UI "Run" button |

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.agents/SYSTEM/FEATURE-SPLIT.md` | Removed webhook triggers, scheduled execution, CLI from Core. Added Telegram Bot, Webhook triggers, Scheduled execution to Cloud SaaS table. Added guidelines #6 (no bot/trigger integrations) and #7 (no CLI/SDK). Updated date. |
| `.agents/skills/scope-validator/SKILL.md` | Added Cloud-Only Features table. Added Rule 5: Bot/Trigger Check. Added Telegram/webhook FAQ entries. Updated Quick Reference with cloud-only features and "Triggers: UI only" note. |
| `.agents/SYSTEM/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Added UI-only trigger note to data flow diagram. Fixed Output node categories (removed WebhookOutput, APIOutput). Replaced SDK package with actual packages (prompts, workflows). |
| `.agents/TASKS/INBOX.md` | Marked Telegram Bot task as moved to Cloud SaaS. Struck through Telegram bot reference in UGC Factory task. |

### Stale References Noted

Grep found webhook/telegram references in these files (left as-is since they're historical records):
- `.agents/SESSIONS/2026-01-21.md` — Session 22 documents the webhook removal process
- `.agents/SESSIONS/2026-01-14.md` — Historical webhook implementation
- `.agents/PRDS/telegram-bot-core.md` — Superseded PRD (core telegram bot was deleted)
- `.agents/PRDS/telegram-bot-workflow.md` — Original PRD, cloud portion still valid
- `.agents/PRDS/kling-motion-control.md` — References Replicate API webhooks (internal mechanism, not external triggers)
- `.agents/PRDS/ugc-factory-*.md` — Historical references to Telegram distribution

### Patterns Established

- Core scope docs now consistently state: **UI-only trigger model**
- Three-doc consistency: FEATURE-SPLIT, scope-validator SKILL, and ARCHITECTURE all align
- Cloud SaaS table in FEATURE-SPLIT is the authoritative scope boundary
