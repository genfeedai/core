# Sessions: 2026-02-01

**Summary:** Remove telegram-bot, sdk, cli from core

---

## Session 1: Remove non-core packages

**Status:** Complete

### What was done

- Deleted `apps/telegram-bot/` (belongs in cloud as a service)
- Deleted `packages/sdk/` (premature — no stable API, no external developers)
- Deleted `packages/cli/` (belongs in genfeedai/cli repo)
- Verified no cross-package imports of `@genfeedai/sdk`, `@genfeedai/cli`, or `telegram-bot`
- Ran `bun install` — lockfile updated, 3 packages removed cleanly
- No changes needed to `package.json` or `turbo.json` (workspace uses glob patterns `apps/*`, `packages/*`)

### Files changed

- `apps/telegram-bot/` - deleted entire directory
- `packages/sdk/` - deleted entire directory
- `packages/cli/` - deleted entire directory
- `bun.lockb` - updated automatically by `bun install`

### Decisions

- **Decision:** No changes to root `package.json` workspace config
  - **Context:** Workspace uses glob patterns (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) not explicit package names
  - **Rationale:** Globs automatically exclude deleted directories, no config change needed

- **Decision:** No changes to `turbo.json`
  - **Context:** `turbo.json` uses generic task definitions (build, dev, lint, test) not package-specific references
  - **Rationale:** No package-specific pipeline entries existed

### Remaining core structure

- `apps/`: api, data, web
- `packages/`: core, prompts, types, workflows

### Next steps

- [ ] Commit the removals
- [ ] Verify CI passes with removed packages
