# Sessions: 2026-02-10

**Summary:** Logger error reporter hook

---

## Session 1: Continue implementation autonomously

**Duration:** ~0.5 hours
**Status:** Complete

### What was done

- Implemented a configurable logger error reporter hook for web app runtime errors.
- Added tests validating reporter callback invocation and unsetting behavior.
- Ran targeted formatter/lint and focused unit tests for touched files.

### Files changed

- `apps/web/src/lib/logger.ts` - added typed `setErrorReporter` support and payload contract.
- `apps/web/src/lib/logger.test.ts` - expanded error path tests for reporter integration.
- `.agents/SESSIONS/2026-02-10.md` - documented session activity.

### Decisions

- **Decision:** Implemented error-tracking integration via callback registration instead of hard coupling to a provider SDK.
  - **Context:** Existing logger had a TODO for Sentry integration but no concrete provider abstraction.
  - **Rationale:** Keeps logger provider-agnostic and allows app/bootstrap code to wire Sentry (or other trackers) without importing provider code into shared logger logic.

### Mistakes and fixes

- **Mistake:** Ran workspace-wide `bun run check` which surfaced unrelated existing warnings.
- **Fix:** Switched to file-scoped Biome commands for touched files only.
- **Prevention:** Use targeted checks by default for incremental slices.

### Next steps

- [ ] Wire logger error reporter to an actual tracking provider in app bootstrap/runtime config.
- [ ] Add similar reporter support to API-side logger if needed for parity.
